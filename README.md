Currency
========

Currency Project

This is a NODE.JS based project which obtains currency movements using the 'openexchangerates.org' currency API.

MongoDB is used as a back end. 

There is a Google Graphs based visualisation front-end (web-based).

Intention is to add advanced analytics to this.
